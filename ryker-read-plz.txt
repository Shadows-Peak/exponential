Right now the only things that are stored on the config file is important stuff, but I think that we should consider adding more, like the names of sheets, and dev options/ user data?
The other thing is how do we plan to organize the sheets for MySQL, 
my thought would be to create a general one for security/user lists and then 1 per user. 

its more about the framework but every peice of data sent to mysql should be checked and given the NOT NULL tag, because the server automatically does this, and its 
better to just do it on the program, expecially if there are multiples users at once
