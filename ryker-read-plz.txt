Right now the only things that are stored on the config file is important stuff, but I think that we should consider adding more, like the names of sheets, and dev options/ user data?
The other thing is how do we plan to organize the sheets for MySQL, 
my thought would be to create a general one for security/user lists and then 1 per user. 

its more about the framework but every peice of data sent to mysql should be checked and given the NOT NULL tag, because the server automatically does this, and its 
better to just do it on the program, expecially if there are multiples users at once

  Via here,
when testing the app, I got a js console error: `Uncaught ReferenceError: abbrev is not defined` pointing to main.js line 91.
Upon further inspection I realized that all over main.js, there are references/calls to variables/functions that aren't defined in the js source, but only in the python source. Idk why you guys did that, but I would consider reimplementing them in javascript.
