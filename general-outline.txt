# IDEAS

The game starts with some random 2 sentence lore about yap regarding your journey to triumph over the lands of Country Club
Gameplay could reflect evolution in a way, starting from collecting sticks hunter gatherer type mindset working up to stuff like the economy features we theorized or even war or smth idk

im very much open to other idea because this randomly came into my mind and then i couldnt think of other ideas because my creativity be dead on no sleep

Games I've played with different mechanics (At least that I could remember or find):

Ordinal Markup              * Going up to large numbers with unique notation, challenges to boost progress, optional choice to not use certain features and reach a point for a boost -- https://patcailmemer.github.io/Ordinal-Markup/
Shark Incremental           * Buildup of growth based on automatic production. Interesting skill tree feature in late game, as well as reactor building that can be optimized -- https://mrredshark77.github.io/shark-incremental/
TMT (Modded)                * (This is technically a collection of mods for the original) Incremental bits of growth over time that starts really fast, but ends up being very bumpy with a lot of time walls. Neat horizontal progression mechanics though -- https://loader3229.github.io/multitree/
Luck Incremental (Modded)   * (This is technically a mod of the original) Really unique mechanic. Interesting way of transfering automatic progress with manually made progress and vice versa -- https://loader3229.github.io/Luck-Incremental/
Incremental Mass (Modded)   * (This is technically a mod of the original) Slow growth but builds up really nicely and has fun mechanics in later game. The classic automatic growth incremental game -- https://loader3229.github.io/incremental-mass-rewritten/
Towers                      * Really wacky one I found that is tedious to play due to having no automation what so ever, however it can feel fun in certain sections to have manual labor affect progress so much -- https://loader3229.github.io/towers/
Time Layers                 * Interesting automatic progress game with achievements that can grant progress in some ways. Fun layer building that all gets ruined on the last 2 layers due to really unclear rules on how to progress -- https://patcailmemer.github.io/Time-Layers/
Grass Cutting Incremental   * (Don't judge the roblox) My favorite incremental game I ever played; inspiration for the original Dilyan Lopez Incremental (somewhat). Has a meh early game, but really fun mid game with mechanics based on a big reset layer, a horizontal progression mechanic, and restraint of using previous features (similar to the Ordinal Markup). Interesting lategame as it becomes super experimental and gimmicky with rpg mechanics and the such. Also features a New Game+ when you beat the whole game https://www.roblox.com/games/9292879820/AWAKENING-Grass-Cutting-Incremental
GCI (Web Remake)            * Mostly just a web remake of the aforementioned Grass Cutting Incremental. I used this as the template for Dilyan Lopez Incremental originally (like the map movement). -- https://mrredshark77.github.io/Really-Grass-Cutting-Incremental/
Antimatter Dimensions       * Also a classic automatic progression based game. I never got very far, but I believe it uses reset layers to remain interesting. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1399720/Antimatter_Dimensions/
Cell to Singularity         * Very fun from result of horizontal progression, weekly based events (that lowkey suck due to horrible pacing) that you can compete against others in, and you can even learn about the real world from playing the game. Biggest appeal is the visual style of a developing tree as you play. -- https://store.steampowered.com/app/977400/Cell_to_Singularity__Evolution_Never_Ends/
Cookie Clicker              * Classic incremental game that most know. Has mediocre horizontal progression in the mid-late game with the minigames. Has an okay reset layer that adds flavor to the normal game. (Side note: very easy and fun to mod this one). Progression is heavily based on inactive playtime after a certain point not even that far into the game. -- https://store.steampowered.com/app/1454400/Cookie_Clicker/
Idle Slayer                 * Unique sidescrolling rpg-like incremental game. Main appeal is the visuals. Strange progression with clustered and hard to read upgrade tree from the reset layer. Reset layer introduces many new mechanics. Minigames dispersed into the game to keep things interesting. -- https://store.steampowered.com/app/1353300/Idle_Slayer/
Idle Spiral                 * I dont even ever remember playing this. It looks like its dierectly based on math formulas and banks off of the visual beauty of curves, but that's it. -- https://store.steampowered.com/app/1827980/Idle_Spiral/
Leaf Blower Revolution      * Super fun game from what I remember. Unique mechanic of having to hover cursor over leaves for them to slowly get blown off screen. Plenty of horizontal progression like pets, currencies to upgrade equipment and pets, complex stat upgrader system that wasn't too unapproachable. Reset layers would hasten your progress with a few new things to spice up gameplay. Game sucks when you reach the Pyramid level as they rely on the most tedious thing I've ever encountered in order to gain progress (And you have to do it a total of 100 times). -- https://store.steampowered.com/app/1468260/Leaf_Blower_Revolution__Idle_Game/
Trimps                      * I never played too much of this, only the beginning, buts its entire concept was re-used in Grass Cutting Incremental so I'm very akin to this progression system. Allocate troops/resources to specific tasks and micro-manage. -- https://trimps.github.io/
Pick Crafter                * Game I played as a kid that was honestly likely only fun due to the Minecraft visuals. Similar mechanics to Idle Slayer, in that you get a currency and level up certain equipment to allow you to do better. -- https://store.steampowered.com/app/734750/PickCrafter/
Grind Craft                 * Legit OG game. I loved this thing to death. Epitome of linear based progression right here. It feels dynamic, understandable, yet complex all at once. -- https://grindcraft.com/game.html
Learn to Fly 3              * Almost seems strange to call this an incremental, but it technically is. Fun mechanic and goal of trying to get as high as possible. Visual appeal is strong. -- https://store.steampowered.com/app/589870/Learn_to_Fly_3/
Duck Life                   * Literally the entirety of duck life was one of my favorite incrementals as a kid. Really simple linear based progression with clearly set goals. -- https://duck-life.io/
mechanics we should have:
Acheivements that give some currency: i really like the idea of achievements giving something like mp from hps where you can use it for tuning what you are doing
Challanges: The challages from dli was one of the best things in it. also challages should have levels where theyvare borderline impossible they make it alot more fun.
Avoid currency creep. Alot of clickers have levels of currency where all of the other ones do not matter anymore. This removes aome level of progression from the game, instead we should focus on the central game loop.
Our early game should be simple, with any mechanics that have a level of emergent complexity ir just complex with a trade off it should be later in the game.
