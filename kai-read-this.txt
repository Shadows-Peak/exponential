After seeing how something this simple didnt work (works in the codespace but not the static website), I think I'm
eventually going to just purchase a cheap Heroku space for us to host stuff on

I'm not going to do this yet  (I only want to spend the money once we have something), but I think its just easiest
(and most fun) if we have a dynamic website to work with. This also means we likely won't need api use (maybe you're
sad about that idk but personally this is great)

In the meantime, we can code general systems
