One of my friends has a spare server and was kind enough to lend it for this project.
I'll be working with them somewhat for things like MySQL and such so that we can have
a server for free that should be up 24/7.
Yay, right?.. Right?.... I'm not going crazy right?

Crazy?

YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID KAI!?




















































THEY














































LOCKED





































ME


































IN








































A


















































ROOM














































A RUBBER ROOM


























































































































































A rubber room with rats.......

..and rats make me crazy...
if we are going crazy it is because we have not commited data to the database using 
mydb.commit()
